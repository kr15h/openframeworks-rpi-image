# openFrameworks RPi Image

Setup that creates a bootable Raspberry Pi disk image with openFrameworks compiled. You can use this as a foundation for your openFrameworks Raspberry Pi projects. 

## Usage

Click on the **Releases** tab to pick your release. Download the disk image file and use [Etcher](https://etcher.io) to burn it.

The username and password is the same as for the default Raspbian image. Username: `pi`. Password: `raspberry`. 

Enjoy!
